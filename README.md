# Label approved and changes requested pull requests

This GitHub Action applies a label of your choice to pull requests that reach a specified number of approvals or changes requested. For teams using [Pull Reminders](https://pullreminders.com), this action can be used to exclude approved or changes requested pull requests from reminders.

## Usage

This Action subscribes to [Pull request review events](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pullrequestreviewevent) which fire whenever pull requests are approved or changes requested. The action requires two environment variables – the label name to add and the number of required approvals or changes requested. Optionally you can provide a label name to remove.

```workflow
on: pull_request_review
name: Label approved pull requests
jobs:
  labelWhenApproved:
    name: Label when approved
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
